#John Grillo Project Notes
##LAST UPDATE: Dec. 5th.
###Partners: Martin Pelayo, Richard Farr 








> ####Dec. 5th: Day 1 of child game project.
Martin is doing the HTML/index pages. Richard is PM/doing the skeleton.

I am working on the basic JavaScript functionality. Richard has told us all to start doing things in CodePen before we write to our main files. I am starting by writing down notes.

I will start with the easiest possible settings for each one.

Functions to program:
1. Game difficulty is easy.
..1 Each difficulty will require a random number generator.
..*Easy: Numbers 0-9.
..*Medium: Numbers 10-99
..*Hard: Numbers 100-999
COMPLETE!

1.2 Do play function
..addition  [complete]
..subtraction
..multiplication
..division

2. Game speed [easy will just be 20 seconds]
3. Rounds function will be in orders of 2, 4 and 6.
4. Start Play function. So I will need a click handler event and more than likely wrap the whole thing in one function.
5. Play again function.


Planned user object will include:
1. A name, which will generate a new user object.
2. Difficulty setting [completed as an anonymous function]
3. score_current (always the current play)
4. score_high [Cumuluative score_current; score_current is always adding to this one]
5. Speed: Only has 20 seconds for now. Will be useful in recording what scheme is used the most.
6. Round: [mostly for tracking what the current round is and how many rounds have been played.]
7. Win/loss ratio [will require a tracker and include variables for win and loss]
